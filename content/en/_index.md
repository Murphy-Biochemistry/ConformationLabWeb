## Welcome to ConformationLab Web

**ConformationLab Studio** is a modern research tool for predicting and exploring protein structures.  
Built on top of **ColabFold** and **AlphaFold2**, it combines machine learning with an accessible interface designed for young researchers.

### With ConformationLab Studio:

- Generate protein structure predictions reliably
- Run locally on any Intel or Apple-Silicon-based machine without complex setup
- Explore resulting models interactively using integrated molecular viewers

ConformationLab Studio makes cutting-edge structural biology methods easier to use — so you can focus on your science.
