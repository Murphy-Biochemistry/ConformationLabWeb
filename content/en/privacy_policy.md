## Collection and storage of personal data
### When visiting the website
The web server (HostGator) automatically collects technical information when you access our site, including:
- IP address of the requesting device
- Date and time of access
- Name and URL of the retrieved file
- Browser type/version and operating system
- Referrer URL (previously visited page)

This data is processed solely to ensure a stable and secure operation of the website (e.g., for troubleshooting, preventing misuse, or maintaining system security).  
Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in ensuring stability and security).
### Login and Authentication
At present, there is no local login on our server. In the future, authentication may be provided exclusively via external providers such as ORCID or Auth0.  
When using these services, your login data is processed directly by the chosen provider. We do not receive your password.  
Depending on the service, we may receive your name, email address, and/or ORCID iD, strictly for the purpose of identifying you within the application.  
Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (processing necessary for contract performance) and Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in secure authentication).

Processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in access control) and Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (performance of a contract or pre-contractual measures, when login/authentication is used).
 
## Storage and data transfer
Server log data is stored temporarily for a maximum of 14 days and then automatically deleted, unless longer storage is required for security or legal purposes.  
We do not sell or otherwise transfer personal data to third parties, except where required by law or for the purpose of hosting (HostGator acts as a data processor under Art. 28 GDPR).  
When using ORCID or Auth0, your data is transferred to these providers in accordance with their privacy policies.  

## Security
We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction, or unauthorized access.  

## Duration of storage
Log data: up to 14 days  
Login data (via ORCID/Auth0): as long as you maintain your account with us  
Longer storage may occur if required by law (e.g., tax or legal retention periods).  
No additional personal data is permanently stored on our servers.
